## 🚀 Announcement

We built a **Windows desktop application** for downloading TCGA data.

Accessing TCGA datasets traditionally required command-line tools and scripting.  
The **HMNexus Team** designed this application to eliminate that barrier by providing a **fully graphical Tkinter-based interface**, allowing researchers to download TCGA data **with zero coding**.

Special thanks to **Siamak Salimy**, our team lead, for managing the project and guiding the development. 💡

This project demonstrates how teamwork can transform complex bioinformatics workflows into simple, accessible solutions.

## Overview

**HMNexus (formerly TCGADownloader)** is a modern, open-source, high-performance desktop application for downloading  
**The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)** data directly from the **NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC)**.

Developed using **Python + Tkinter**, HMNexus provides a **code-free, GUI-driven workflow** for manifest-based TCGA downloads, making large-scale cancer genomics data accessible to:

- Biologists  
- Clinicians  
- Medical researchers  
- Students and trainees  

without requiring programming expertise.

## Project Naming

> **HMNexus** is the official project name.  
> The tool was previously referred to as **TCGADownloader** during early development.

## Abstract

**Background**  
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a foundational resource for cancer genomics research. However, downloading TCGA data typically requires command-line tools or scripting, limiting accessibility for non-technical users. While the NCI GDC Data Transfer Tool supports manifest-based downloads, it does not provide a graphical interface or interactive dataset exploration.

**Results**  
We present **HMNexus**, an open-source, Tkinter-based desktop application that integrates intuitive graphical dataset selection with high-speed, manifest-driven downloads from the GDC portal. Users can browse TCGA datasets by cancer type and data category, import or export GDC manifest files, and perform optimized concurrent downloads using a point-and-click interface. Benchmark experiments on a BRCA cohort (18.2 GB) demonstrate up to **4.8× faster** downloads compared to sequential command-line workflows under default settings. Downloaded files are automatically organized into analysis-ready directory structures.

**Conclusions**  
HMNexus bridges the gap between usability and performance, enabling rapid and effortless TCGA data access. The tool is cross-platform, lightweight (Python 3 + Tkinter), and released under the MIT License.

## Performance Benchmark (Example)

| Tool | Interface | Time (18.2 GB BRCA cohort) | Coding Required |
|----|----|----|----|
| **HMNexus** | GUI (Tkinter) | **12 min 18 sec** | No |
| GDC Data Transfer Tool | CLI | 58 min 42 sec | Yes |
| TCGAbiolinks (R) | Scripted | ~54 min | Yes |

> Performance depends on network bandwidth and system resources.
